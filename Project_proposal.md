## The tentative project title

Your Ultimate Guide to Healthy Food Shopping in NYC: Eat Well, Live
Better!

## The motivation for this project

To understand and improve access to healthy food options in NYC,
addressing public health challenges related to food accessibility and
quality

Access to healthy food is essential for public health, yet many NYC
neighborhoods lack nutritious options, particularly in low-income areas.
Our project maps health food accessibility across NYC, examining factors
like proximity to subway stations, neighborhood income, and housing
prices. By exploring the relationship between food access and health
outcome, we aim to inform residents and urban planners, shedding light
on disparities and supporting healthier, more equitable communities.

## The intended final products

1.  Interactive maps a.accessibility of healthy stores and distance from
    subway stations. b. Concentration of healthy stores in each zip code
    area (with polygons showing the zip codes). Concentration is shown
    by color schemes.

2.  Graphs showing association of housing price and healthy store
    concentration

3.  Interactive bar chart with comparison of health conditions with
    store concentration in each borough of NYC

## The anticipated data sources

Primary Dataset: Recognized_Shop_Healthy_Stores_20241105

Additional Datasets:

1.  Subway Stations Dataset: MTA_Subway_Stations_20241106

2.  NYC Health Data: Borough-level data on obesity and diabetes rates

3.  NYC Housing data (based on zip code)

4.  NYC Farmerâ€™s market dataset

5.  Food price data in 2019

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

##### Analyses:

Assess accessibility of stores by proximity to subway stations and
walkability

Measure neighborhood concentration of healthy stores and its correlation
with obesity and diabetes rates

Compare median household income and housing prices with accessibility
and concentration of healthy food options

##### Visualizations:

charts for grocery prices across boroughs Graphs showing association of
housing price and concentration of healthy stores  
Interactive bar chart with comparison of health conditions with store
concentration in each borough of NYC

##### Coding challenges:

Some datasets might have many missing data

Joining process between datasets could cause missing data.

## The planned timeline

##### Weekly Team Meetings: Mondays, 6-7 pm

Ongoing from November 11 through December 7

##### Project Phases:

1.  Data Collection & Cleaning: Week of Nov 11

2.  Gather and prepare data for analysis.

3.  Exploratory Analysis: Weeks of Nov 18 & Nov 25

4.  Conduct initial analysis and visualizations.

5.  Final Analysis & Visualizations: Week of Dec 2
